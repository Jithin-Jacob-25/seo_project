    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h2>The Inspiration Behind TripleLite</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, a simple moment can change everything. For founders Ron and Nancy Pritchett, that moment came one dark evening in 2012 when Ron nearly fell because his flashlight didn’t illuminate the entire path. That slip sparked an idea: what if a flashlight matched the human field of vision?
    </p>

    <p>
      Motivated by safety, they created a flashlight that goes beyond the narrow tunnel of traditional beams. After extensive testing, the TripleLite flashlight with 180° wide-beam technology was born—illuminating the entire area in front of you, just as your eyes do naturally.
    </p>

    <h2>Why 180° Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Walk safely at night with full-field lighting</li>
      <li>Navigate stairs and dim paths with confidence</li>
      <li>Wide visibility for camping and emergencies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety First, Always</h2>
    <p>
      TripleLite flashlights offer intuitive use, bright output, and energy efficiency. With a firm grip and curved body, they're designed for both comfort and function. Our technology ensures that every step you take is well-lit—enhancing visibility and reducing risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Innovation That Speaks for Itself</h2>
    <p>
      With five utility patents and a design patent, TripleLite has transformed the flashlight industry. From QVC sellouts to Shark Tank fame, and retail placements in Ace Hardware and Big 5, our journey is just getting started.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re not just building flashlights. We’re lighting the path forward with smart, user-focused design that matches how humans truly see the world—wide and clear.
